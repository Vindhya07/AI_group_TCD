# Contributions were as follows:
Anoushka Mittal:
Code - Searched for relevant Github Links, assessed their running status, suitably edited chosen codes to make them run successfully 
Report - Collected the relevant papers for the literature review and worked on the presentation
> Introduction
> Related Work
> Slides - ppt
Was also responsible for organisation, communication and meetings

Kalaivani Kandasamy:
Code - Helped with editing a crucial code to make it run successfully and performed the integration of Pierre Dellacherie with the other algorithms 

Report -
> Problem Definition and Algorithms
> Conclusion
> Slides - ppt

Miguel Lopez:
Code - Pair programmed with Kalaivany and Anoushka and offered important insights and suggestions for faster resolution of errors and conflicts 

Report - 
> Introduction,
> Related work,
> Evaluation Metrics

Vindhya Nagaraj:
Code - 
> Performance Comparison and Evaluation of the Four Algorithms,
> Calculated time, score and lines cleared for performance,
> Baseline Local Search Algorithm implementation

Report - 
> Abstract,
> Problem Definition and Algorithms,
> Evaluation Metrics

>- Disclaimer:
We also used Google Docs extensively to compile and share resources; and a large amount of pair programming was done for better results and lesser commits as editing parallely would have led to merge conflicts
