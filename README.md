# Contributions:
Anoushka Mittal:
Code - Searched for relevant Github Links, assessed their running status, suitably edited chosen codes to make them run successfully.
Report - Collected the relevant papers for the literature review and worked on the presentation, Introduction, Related Work, Slides - ppt
Was responsible for organisation, communication and meetings.


Kalaivani Kandasamy:
Code - Implemented DFS, MCTS and Genetic algorithms in code, Integration of Pierre Dellacherie with the other algorithms.
Report - Problem Definition and Algorithms, Conclusion, Slides - ppt. 

Miguel Lopez:
Code - Pair programmed with Kalaivani and Anoushka and offered important insights and suggestions for faster resolution of errors and conflicts, finalized evaluation approaches for comparison of algorithms.
Report - Introduction, Related work, Evaluation Metrics, Presentation(video).

Vindhya Nagaraj:
Code - Calculated and plotted time-score and time-linesCleared for performance, Performance Comparison and Evaluation of the Four Algorithms,  Baseline Local Search Algorithm implementation.
Report - Abstract, Problem Definition and Algorithms, Evaluation Metrics, Conclusion, Explored articles/journals for Literature Review.

>- Disclaimer:
We used Google Docs extensively to compile and share resources; and a large amount of pair programming was done for better results.
